  	<h2>Who is Matthew Daly and why you should hire him(me)?</h2>

  	<p class="firstP">
		Like most people, I am many different things depending on the situation, most germane to this conversation - I am a guy who loves code. Though new to the subject (about a year in now), it has become increasingly clear to me this where I want to spend most of my time. 
	</p>

	<p>
		As to why you should consider me; I think I have a combination of skills that would make me a great candidate for the position. For the past ten years I have been working as an educator throughout South East Asia, which gives me a unique skill set: the patience of a teacher, the understanding that to help someone (be it student or customer) you have to meet them where they are, and the ability to adapt to novel situations quickly and successfully. 
	</p>

	<p>
		I also have a strong background in customer service and sales from my career before deciding to vagabond around the world. 
	</p>

	<p>
		More importantly than any of the above; you should consider me because I love solving problems in code (check out my CodeWars profile above to see how much) and I love working with people. 
	</p>

	<hr>

	<h2>No</h2>

  	<p class="firstP">
		Back in the bad old days of the Dot.com boom in San Francisco, I worked for SquareTrade, which at that time was doing dispute resolution for eBay buyers and sellers. 
	</p>

	<p>
		My job mainly consisted of saying no - a lot. Mostly to sellers who wanted negative feedback removed from their profiles. At that time there was no procedure to have feedback taken off, usually all we could do was put a blurb on the seller's profile saying that they had tried to resolve the issue. 
	</p>

	<p>
		To say that the majority of the people I worked with were upset would be putting it mildly. For the most part, they were honest people who worked very hard to create their business only to have it hurt by what they saw as  an unjustified attack. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Unfortunately, there was little I could do for most of them, except listen. But turns out that listening helps, it really does. Commiserating, feeling like you're being heard and not just sending emails off into a void...it all helps.  That job really taught me that you deal with people, not problems. Sometimes you can't resolve a problem, but if you deal with the people decently, it may be enough. 
	</p>

	<h2>Is the customer always right?</h2>

  	<p class="firstP">
		No.
	</p>

	<p>
		Is the customer satisfied? Are you able to satisfy the customer? I think those are better questions. A lot of customer service is managing customer expectations.  
	</p>

	<p>
		As long as you are accurately representing yourself, the organization and the product I think you are doing the best that can be expected. Not all products are right for every customer. Some may be better served by a different product or service. There is no point in trying to sell hotdogs to a vegan or mushroom burgers to an avowed carnivore.

	<h2>Questions Three</h2>

  	<p class="firstP">
		Pre-Sales <br>
		Fire Alarm <br>
		Step-By-Step<br>
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Pre-Sales:</b> While the Product Customizer does not have that exact feature, with the release of version 2.0, it is now an embedded app in Shopify - meaning depending on your normal workflow that might not be an  issue. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The power of the app is its ability to meet the needs of individual sellers; if you let me know a bit more how you are thinking of using it (ie what kinds of issues you are running into currently, what type of customization you would like to be able to do), I would be able to give you an idea of how it could help you maximize your efforts and really make your brand stand out.
	</p>
	<p> Thanks <br>

		Matt	   
	</p>

	<p>
		<p><b>Fire Alarm:</b> The first thing I would do is a quick assessment of the nature of the problems the customers are facing, looking for patterns, ie does it look like server problems, account login problems, is it specific to a particular product... then I would contact the proper person (depending on the protocol) to report the issue and find out if it is a known one. </p>
		<p>
		Depending on their response, I would then do a number of things. If there was anything I could do to start resolving the issue myself, I would start taking action. If the solution depended on another's actions, I would start contacting the customers letting them know that we are working on the issue and that I will keep them updated with information as it became available. I would also start any bug reporting processes, as needed.

	<p>
		<b>Step-By-Step</b><br>
		How to Purchase a GH4 Digital Camera: <br>
		Step 1: Spend months thinking about getting a new camera. <br>
		Step 2: Spend another few months researching cameras online. <br>
		Step 3: Realize you know nothing about cameras and call your friend who is a filmmaker. He recommends the aforementioned GH4. <br>
		Step 4: Spend another couple of months comparing the GH4 to every other camera in the world, calling your friend to debate every feature until he finally stops taking your calls. <br>
		Step 5: Buy the GH4 and love it. <br>
		Step 6: Take your friend to dinner for being a pain.
